### Breezy Point

#### North Seas

##### Gospel Boulder

###### The Deity

1. **Missing name**

   The problem is listed in the book as the sixth problem on this boulder,
   without a name. Its original name, given by the first ascensionists, is _The
   Deity_.

###### Rerighting the Gospel

1. **Incorrect start**

   In the book, the problem is described as sharing a start with _The Deity_
   (6) on the right side of the wash, beginning from a sit start. Originally,
   it was established using a squat/sit start, with the left hand on a
   down-pulling sloper and the right hand on a slightly lower crimp, positioned
   directly below the problemâ€™s finish.
