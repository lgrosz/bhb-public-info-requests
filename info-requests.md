# Requests

These requests are not documented, as unconfirmed or otherwise, within Black Hills Bouldering publications.

- *Backcountry Lava Game*, V6

  From Justin Jaeger's 8a logbook. Though not marked as one, this is likely a Justin Jaeger first ascent. Entry was added 1 January 2003 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the description "cruxylog+rockjumping." To me, this implies the approach was less than ideal. There were no other entries from the Black Hills around that same time from Justin.

## Iron Mountain Road

- *Wrestling with a Grizzly Bear*, V8

  From Dan Dewell's 8a logbook. Entry was added 5 June 2005 in an unknown sector of Iron Mountain with the description "crimpy 5\*boulder." It was rated 5/5 stars, implying it is quite a good problem. There were no other problems ticked around the same time. The word *Grizzly* in the name implies it may be in the *Grizzly Boulders* (northeastern *Land of the Way-Too-Highs*) or along *Grizzly Bear Creek*.

- *Illuminati*, V4

  From Kai Segrund's 8a logbook. Entry was added 19 June 2009 in an uknown sector of the Black Hills with no description. This entry is accompanied by two "N.N." ticks of grades V2 and V3, added on the same day. I assume this problem exists on Iron Mountain Road since Gary Carnes added entries to his logbook the next day and the two are known acquaintances. Gary's entries from that day include the schist traverse and the *Light Bulb Moment* drop-off at *Rubik's Ridge*, and *Looks Like a Va-Jay-Jay* (*As the Skin Thins*) at *Turtle Dome*. This problem is likely an alias to a problem already in a Black Hills Bouldering publication.

## Old Baldy Mountain

- *Give It the Finger*, V7

  From Chipper Phillips and Justin Jaeger's 8a scorecards. Chipper Phillips' entry was made 30 May 2004 in an unknown sector of Old Baldy with a description "sit&go&stickitin." He gave it 3/5 stars and marked it as an FA. This entry is accompanied by an entry for *Stranglehold*. Justin Jaeger's entry was made 30 May 2004 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the description "burly crimp sds." He gate it 1/5 stars. It is accompanied by mulitple entries in *Irie Heights* such as *The Healing*, *The Offering*, and *Tastes Like Burning* as well as a *Sport Action Arete* eliminate. This all leads me to believe that *Give It the Finger* is a below average quality problem. It is most likely located somewhere in *Irie Heights*, but has the potential to be anywhere at Baldy, including along *Camp Judson Road*. The name and descriptions imply that it is a crimpy sit start, likely with a stab at some hold somehwere in the problem.

- *Stroller*, V8-11

  From Dan Dewells and Michael Madsen's 8a scorecards. Dan Dewell's entry was made 6 June 2005 in an unknown sector of Old Baldy with a description "with the sickness." He gave it 3/5 stars, a rating of V8, and marked it as an FA. Michael Madsen's entry was made 16 February 2014 in *Cell One Valley*. He gave it 5/5 stars and a rating of V10. I have received some information, including a photo and an upgrade to V11, of this supposed problem but I remain skeptical. The photo is located at the "top" of *Cell One Valley* but looks *extremely improbable*, even for V11. If this was *Stroller*, I doubt Dan Dewell would've graded it V8 considering 1. he supposedly climbed it in June, 2. he repeated The Prow in December of the same year and gave it V10.

## Sylvan Lake

- *Seared and Seething*, V4-7

  From Justin Jaeger's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 31 May 2004 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the description "FA 2move roof V4-7?." He gave it 1/5 stars and marked it as an FA. Other entries from that same day include *Temper Tantrum*, *Hatori Hanso*, *Samurai*, and *Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique*. I have also receive information from a third party saying this problem resides at Sylvan Lake. I am unsure if it may belong to *The Outlets* - like at the *Don Juan Boulder* -, at the *Honeymoon Boulders*, or elsewhere.
