# Requests

These requests are not documented, as unconfirmed or otherwise, within Black Hills Bouldering publications.

- *Backcountry Lava Game*, V6

  From Justin Jaeger's 8a logbook. Though not marked as one, this is likely a Justin Jaeger first ascent. Entry was added 1 January 2003 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the description "cruxylog+rockjumping." To me, this implies the approach was less than ideal. There were no other entries from the Black Hills around that same time from Justin.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBackcountry%20Lava%20Game%5D)

## Iron Mountain Road

- *Wrestling with a Grizzly Bear*, V8

  From Dan Dewell's 8a logbook. Entry was added 5 June 2005 in an unknown
  sector of Iron Mountain with the description "crimpy 5\*boulder." It was
  rated 5/5 stars, implying it is quite a good problem. There were no other
  problems ticked around the same time. The word *Grizzly* in the name implies
  it may be in the *Grizzly Boulders* (northeastern *Land of the
  Way-Too-Highs*) or along *Grizzly Bear Creek*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BWrestling%20with%20a%20Grizzly%20Bear%5D)

- *Illuminati*, V4

  From Kai Segrud's 8a logbook. Entry was added 19 June 2009 in an uknown
  sector of the Black Hills with no description. This entry is accompanied by
  two "N.N." ticks of grades V2 and V3, added on the same day. I assume this
  problem exists on Iron Mountain Road since Gary Carnes added entries to his
  logbook the next day and the two are known acquaintances. Gary's entries from
  that day include the schist traverse and the *Light Bulb Moment* drop-off at
  *Rubik's Ridge*, and *Looks Like a Va-Jay-Jay* (*As the Skin Thins*) at
  *Turtle Dome*. This problem is likely an alias to a problem already in a
  Black Hills Bouldering publication.

## Old Baldy Mountain

- *MC Ollie*, V4, Greg Parker

  Likely between or around problems such as *Fisticuffs*/*Broken Hearts* and
  *Hidden Adjenda*. Upon further discussion it seems *MC Ollie* was most likely
  on *Schistty Ridge* in some manner. The ordering of the problems imply it's
  left of *Broken Hearts*, though that isn't confirmed. Has been described as
  possibly a "non-descript squattie."

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BMC%20Ollie%5D)

  There are also a few more undefined problems a V1 and two V2s, all FA'd by Greg Parker as sit starts. These are likely to the right of *Fisticuffs*, near *Brilliant*, or somewhere close by.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BRandoms%20around%20Fisticuffs%20or%20Brillaint%5D)

- Random/unnamed "backside"/*Irie Heights* problems

  - *V0+ Travis Rypkema*

    Likely near the subsequent problem.

  - *One Move Dyno*, V1, Travis Rypkema

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BRandom%20backside%20problems%20by%20Travis%5D)

  - Traverse into Dyno, V3, Greg Parker

    Likely a traverse into the sesequent problem.

  - Travis Dyno, V2

    Travis Rypkema FA, or just a typo?

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BRandom%20backside%20dyno%20with%20traverse%5D)

- Brain Fart, V6, Greg Parker

  A problem described as "little 5' boulder that is really hard." Possibly near
  the previous two problem sets.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBrain%20Fart%5D)

- Stolen Thunder, V4, Greg Parker

  Sit start. Likely around the likes of *Isosceles Look-a-like*, *Grips*,
  *Pulling Back a Stump*, etc.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BStolen%20Thunder%5D)

- Pulling Back a Stump, V5, Greg Parker

  Likely near the aforementioned and subsequently mentioned problems.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BPulling%20Back%20a%20Stump%5D)

- Low-end, but kind of named, Travis problems

  - Grips, V1, Travis Rypkema

    Sit start

  - Scary, V1, Travis Rypkema

  - Pansy, V1, Travis Rypkema

  - V0-, Travis Rypkema

- *Marcel's Block*

  This is a large block developed by Marcel Mondova and Chipper Phillips. It is
  located southeastwardly adjacent to *Stranglehold*. It is estimated 11-13
  problems exist in the low-moderate grade range. The block is known, the
  problems are not.

- *Ego Stroke Arete*, V8, Chuck Fryberger

  From Chuck Fryberger's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 4 July 2003, in an
  unknown sector of Black Hills with the description "FA verm beta." Given 1/5
  stars. This entry is accompanied by an entry for *Goat Problem*, see below.
  The following day, Chuck ticked *Making Puppies*, *Kiss the Groove*, and
  *Dagron's Arete*. This leads me to believe these problems may be located
  around Baldy or maybe in Wayward Valley. These were likely done during the
  filming of *Friction Addiction*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BEgo%20Stroke%20Arete%5D)

- *Goat Problem*, V9, Chuck Fryberger

  From Chuck Fryberger's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 4 July 2003, in an
  unknown sector of Black Hills with the description "FA orange jump start"
  Given 3/5 stars. This entry is accompanied by an entry for *Goat Problem*,
  see above for more related commentary.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BGoat%20Problem%5D)

- *Eggspression*, V4

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 20 November 2003 in an
  unknown sector at Baldy with the description "not great". The only stretch of
  a lead I have on this problem is problems on *Eggstraordinary* are also
  egg-themed..

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BEggspression%5D)

- *Teen Girl Club*, V4

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 23 December 2003 in and
  unknown sector of Old Baldy with the description "short roof." It was
  accompanied by a tick of *Right Handed Isosceles* the same day. I was told by
  a third party it was near the *Almost There Boulders*, but I'm not too
  convinced of that at the moment.

- Mysterious Caddyshack Boulder Fryberger V8s

  It has been reported to that Dan Dewell witnessed ascents of two V8-ish
  problems on the tall, steep face of the Caddyshack Boulder by Chuck
  Fryberger. I have assumed one of these V8 was a stand start left of
  *Looming*. That problem is still unconfirmed. The second V8 on the otherhand
  is a total mystery to me.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BCaddyshack-Fryberger%5D)

- *Give It the Finger*, V7, Chipper Phillips

  From Chipper Phillips and Justin Jaeger's 8a scorecards. Chipper Phillips'
  entry was made 30 May 2004 in an unknown sector of Old Baldy with a
  description "sit&go&stickitin." He gave it 3/5 stars and marked it as an FA.
  This entry is accompanied by an entry for *Stranglehold*. Justin Jaeger's
  entry was made 30 May 2004 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the
  description "burly crimp sds." He gate it 1/5 stars. It is accompanied by
  mulitple entries in *Irie Heights* such as *The Healing*, *The Offering*, and
  *Tastes Like Burning* as well as a *Sport Action Arete* eliminate. This all
  leads me to believe that *Give It the Finger* is a below average quality
  problem. It is most likely located somewhere in *Irie Heights*, but has the
  potential to be anywhere at Baldy, including along *Camp Judson Road*. The
  name and descriptions imply that it is a crimpy sit start, likely with a stab
  at some hold somehwere in the problem.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BGive%20It%20the%20Finger%5D)

- Several Ken Gibson problems near *Apparition*

  Supposedly these are problems in the range of V0-4 that run in a corridor
  near or downhill from *Apparition*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BKen%20Gibson%20Corridor%5D)

- *Stroller*, V8-11, Dan Dewell

  From Dan Dewells and Michael Madsen's 8a scorecards. Dan Dewell's entry was
  made 6 June 2005 in an unknown sector of Old Baldy with a description "with
  the sickness." He gave it 3/5 stars, a rating of V8, and marked it as an FA.
  Michael Madsen's entry was made 16 February 2014 in *Cell One Valley*. He
  gave it 5/5 stars and a rating of V10. I have received some information,
  including a photo and an upgrade to V11, of this supposed problem but I
  remain skeptical. The photo is located at the "top" of *Cell One Valley* but
  looks *extremely improbable*, even for V11. If this was *Stroller*, I doubt
  Dan Dewell would've graded it V8 considering 1. he supposedly climbed it in
  June, 2. he repeated The Prow in December of the same year and gave it V10.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BStroller%5D)


- *Fit in the Sloper*, V4/5

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 6 July 2005 in an uknown
  sector at Baldy with the description "technically nota flash, but...". It was
  also accompanied by entries on the same day of *Banshee* and *Ghost Town
  Litigant*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BFit%20in%20the%20Sloper%5D)

  Dan's scorecard contained another kind of "unnamed" entry on the same day,
  *Blake's Problem--left of 'Fit in the Sloper'*, V5/6. It had a description
  "Blake should send LayDS next." It think this is a sarcastic remark that this
  problem started abnormally low for the time.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BLeft%20of%20Fit%20in%20the%20Sloper%5D)

- *Kung Fu Spotting*, V4/5

  From Chipper Phillips' 8a scorecard. Entry was added 11 September 2005 in an
  uknown sector of Baldy with the description "stressfulfalls-nicespotJJ." It
  was accompanied by entries for *Jug City* and *Hueco Problem.* If I am to
  believe Justin Jaeger was along for the ride on this one, then looking at
  Justin's 8a scorecard, it is also accompanied by entries for *Banshee*,
  *Ghost Town Litigant*, *The Rambunction*, *Award Tour*, *Jug City*,
  *Skypager*, and *Organ Donor*. All this is to say, maybe it's in *Cell One
  Valley* - or maybe it's just somewhere random at Baldy.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BKung%20Foo%20Spotting%5D)

- *Stand and Deliver*, V8

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 14 January 2006 in and
  unknown sector of Mount Baldy with the description "big, tension-rich
  movement." This entry was accompanied by an entry for *Sit Down and Be
  Counted* and *Puff Daddy* on the same day. Therefore, I think it is likely
  this problem is located in *Old Baldy's Melon Patch*. I think it's even more
  likely the problem is located nearest *Sit Down and Be Counted* given how
  similarly phrased its name is. It may even be a variation on the
  aforementioned problem.

- *Deceptively Easy*, V3

  From Kai Segrud's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 17 June 2006 at Old Baldy
  with the description "Neat". It is accompanied by an entry on the same day
  for *Wrestling With a Gerbil*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BDeceptively%20Easy%5D)

- *Bald Ass Bob*, V3, Lee Terveen

  A short problem described to be me by Lee Terveen. It is located near the
  west entrance to the *Sanitarium*, much further west, downhill, than the
  *Superfly Boulder*. It is supposedly a sit start on the far left side of a
  boulder's face and trends right on slopers. It was also mentioned there was a
  boulder problem "behind it" which Lee considered more featured.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBald%20Ass%20Bob%5D)

## Sylvan Lake

- *Seared and Seething*, V4-7

  From Justin Jaeger's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 31 May 2004 in an unknown
  sector of the Black Hills with the description "FA 2move roof V4-7?." He gave
  it 1/5 stars and marked it as an FA. Other entries from that same day include
  *Temper Tantrum*, *Hatori Hanso*, *Samurai*, and *Five Point Palm Exploding
  Heart Technique*. I have also receive information from a third party saying
  this problem resides at Sylvan Lake. I am unsure if it may belong to *The
  Outlets* - like at the *Don Juan Boulder* -, at the *Honeymoon Boulders*, or
  elsewhere.

## Lost Media

- Mike Olson, *a.k.a. Red Dot Guy*, documentation

  Mike Olson was the infmaous "Red Dot Guy," who would paint red dots below his
  perceived first ascents. While many (most?) of these were already established
  problems, there were a few that are likely to be credited to him. Mike Olson
  did document his problems in a book or pamphlet. I have not been able to get
  my hands on this pamplet, but would love the opportunity.

## The advent of bouldering

Problems which I have discovered from the 1950s and 1960s are few and far
bewteen. These problems include those on the Campground Boulder, Inner
Outlet, the Outlet Boulder, the Thimble, the Scab, and the Butterfly Boulder.
There were a multitude of problems which I have failed to located or document
accurately.

### Herb and Jan Conn

Though they may not be modern boulders, John Gill writes in his personal blog
about Herb and Jan Conn...

> In the Needles of South Dakota, starting in 1949, Jan and Herb Conn
> practiced long ground-level traverses when not making first ascents of
> spires.

### 1950s and 1960s

Subsequently, he writes about introducing modern bouldering to the Hills in
the 1950s...

> I began visiting the Black Hills in the mid 1950s, introducing modern
> bouldering there. 
>
> From the late 1950s through the mid 1960s a number of (then) difficult
> problems were done on the coarse granite. 
>
> Other climbers contributing substantially to Needle bouldering during the
> 1960s include Bob Kamps, Rich Goldstone, and Pete Cleveland.
>
> All the classic problems on the Sylvan Lake Boulder were done by the early
> 1960s.  The Outlet Boulder was done a year or so later.

I have not located any *concrete problems*, though I have located some
formations, that can be directly attributed to anyone other than John Gill.
