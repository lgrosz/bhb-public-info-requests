# Requests

These requests are not documented, as unconfirmed or otherwise, within Black Hills Bouldering publications.

- *Backcountry Lava Game*, V6

  From Justin Jaeger's 8a logbook. Though not marked as one, this is likely a Justin Jaeger first ascent. Entry was added 1 January 2003 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the description "cruxylog+rockjumping." To me, this implies the approach was less than ideal. There were no other entries from the Black Hills around that same time from Justin.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBackcountry%20Lava%20Game%5D)

## Iron Mountain Road

- *Illuminati*, V4

  From Kai Segrud's 8a logbook. Entry was added 19 June 2009 in an uknown
  sector of the Black Hills with no description. This entry is accompanied by
  two "N.N." ticks of grades V2 and V3, added on the same day. I assume this
  problem exists on Iron Mountain Road since Gary Carnes added entries to his
  logbook the next day and the two are known acquaintances. Gary's entries from
  that day include the schist traverse and the *Light Bulb Moment* drop-off at
  *Rubik's Ridge*, and *Looks Like a Va-Jay-Jay* (*As the Skin Thins*) at
  *Turtle Dome*. This problem is likely an alias to a problem already in a
  Black Hills Bouldering publication.

## Mount Rushmore

- Kai Segrud problems

    Both of the following problems were from Kai Segrunds 8a scorecard. Both
    entries were made 19 November 2006, where *Mother Fuckin' Yeah* was also
    marked as an FA. It is unclear exactly where these are, but they are likely
    next to each other. They may not be in the Rushmore area, but rather in
    "Breezy Point/North Seas" area, or even at Baldy. Kai was inconsistent with
    where his entries were made on his scorecard.

  - *Warmup #07601*, V3

  - *Mother Fuckin' Yeah*, V2

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BKai%20Segrud%20Rushmore%20Problems%5D)

- *Ass Slammer*, V6, Josh Dreher

    From Josh Dreher's 8a scorecard. The entry was made 31 October 2006 with
    the description "shitty arete." It was accompanied by entries for *Torso
    Fritter*, *Cheese Grater*, and *Nipple Pincher*. Therefore this problem
    seems likely to be in South Seas, near *Bueno* and such, or possibly in
    a sector of Baldy.

- *Nipple Pincher*, V6, Josh Dreher

    From Josh Dreher's 8a scorecard. The entry was made 31 October 2006 with
    the description "[s]weet one mover." See the previous info request for more
    commentary.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BNipple%20Pincher%5D)

- *Dashboard Confessions*, V3, Gary Carnes

  From Gary Carnes' 8a scorecard. The entry was made on 15 April 2009 in the
  *Marker* crag of *Mount Rushmore* with the description "Really, really fun
  warm up or cool down! Superb." I am unsure if *Marker* in this case means
  *Emancipation Rockphormation* or *Magna Carta*. This entry was accompanied by
  entries for *Remember to Breath* and *Hands Down*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BDashboard%20Confessions%5D)

- *Remember to Breath*, V3, Gary Carnes

  From Gary Carnes' 8a scorecard. The entry was made on 15 April 2009 in the
  *Marker* crag of *Mount Rushmore* with the description "Sloper start to a
  [strenuous] top out. Remember to breath." I am unsure if *Marker* in this
  case means *Emancipation Rockphormation* or *Magna Carta*. This entry was
  accompanied by entries for *Dashboard Confessions* and *Hands Down*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BRemember%20to%20Breath%5D)

- *Hands Down*, V5, Gary Carnes

  From Gary Carnes' 8a scorecard. The entry was made on 15 April 2009 in the
  *Marker* crag of *Mount Rushmore* with the description "Sharp hand match
  crimps and crank it out. FUN!" I am unsure if *Marker* in this case means
  *Emancipation Rockphormation* or *Magna Carta*. This entry was accompanied by
  entries for *Dashboard Confessions* and *Remember to Breath*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BHands%20Down%5D)

- *Mixed Tape*, V5, Gary Carnes

  From Gary Carnes' and Josh Dreher's 8a scorecard. Gary's entry was made on 16
  April 2009 in the *Marker* crag of *Mount Rushmore* with the description "5
  moves with a powerfull start." Josh's entry was made on 30 Semptember 2009
  with the description "Second ascent. Gary's project is hard and it hurts and
  it's reachy and it makes my bum wet. What?" I'm unsure if any of this
  information is related to this problem (ha). I'm also unsure if *Marker* in
  this case means *Emancipation Rockphormation* or *Magna Carta*. But it's
  likely close to the previous three listings as Gary's entry was made a day
  after those.

- *Bug Bomb*, V2, Josh Dreher

  From Josh Dreher's 8a scorecard. The entry was made 3 June 2009 in the
  *Marker* crag of *Mount Rushmore* with the description "Back and forth twice
  then done. Next to Gary's V0--- warmup...". This problem was accompanied by
  entries for several other problems in *Emancipation Rockphormation* such as
  *Rain Fingers* and *Cougar's Nest*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBug%20Bomb%5D)

### Emancipation Rockphormation

- *Black Hole*, V2 and *Duck Butt*, V4, Gary Carnes

  *Black Hole* was from both Gary Carnes and Josh Dreher's 8a scorecards.
  Gary's entry was made on 1 September 2009 with a description, "[f]un little
  diddy above [J]osh's [*Fire Breathing Duck*.]"

  *Duck Butt*, or *Black Hole Sit*, had entries by both Gary and Josh. Gary's
  entry was made 14 September 2004. Josh's description was a bit more
  revealing, "[s]econd ascent behind Gary... Fun sloper trav[erse.]"

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBlack%20Hole%5D)

### Chopping Block

- *Tennis Shoe Tickle Fest*, V1, Josh Dreher

    From Josh Dreher 8a scorecard. The entry was made 7 September 2009, with
    the description, "[i]n North Park. Obvious slope traverse. Did in tennis shoes
    after some fun route climbing..." That same day he had score card entries
    for *The Lean Years,* 5.11- and a couple unnamed low-end sport climbs.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BTennis%20Shoe%20Tickle%20Fest%5D)

### South Seas

- *Fatty Magoo*, V5, Michael Madsen

    This problem was listed on MP with the description...

    > This problem is located by Bueno in the South Seas. Fatty Magoo was once
    > ugly... and had no friends. Given a few years and some clean up she is a
    > whole new person just like this block. Cleaned up nicely and was often
    > overlooked or forgotten. If you are looking at Bueno this is the roof
    > behind you and in the corner. Start down and low on the left side (
    > closest to corner) Undercling and move to the sharp but good crimps. Crux
    > is getting good feet and matching both hands on the 2nd crimp. DON'T BAIL
    > TO EARLY. Take it out to the arÃªte and then up. Good warm up problem
    > close to the parking lot.

    And the directions...

    > by Bueno in South Seas. Obvious roof in the corner right by the natural
    > spring / ice flow depending on season on the trail by bueno. Look left
    > when on the trail.

    I cannot determine what this problem is. Is it possibly the same "shitty
    arete" as Josh Dreher's *Ass Slammer*?

## Breezy Point

- *In the Ghetto*, V4, Bo Fuks

    From Josh Dreher's 8a scorecard. Entry was made 1 November 2006 with the
    description "Bo's problem downhill from gNar. Good V4." I think this is
    likely an alias for a problem on the *Tennis Shoe Boulder*.

    [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BIn%20the%20Ghetto%5D)

- *Ms. Crabtree*, V7, Josh Dreher

    description "weird fun." Entry was accompanied by entries for *Kansas City
    Shuffle*, *Release*, *Zero Tolerance*, and *Sleven Caldera*. Based on the
    problems *Kansas City Shuffle* and *Release*, I believe this problem to be
    in the *Breezy Point* area.

    description "two moves to a funky top-out." Entry was accompanied by
    entries for *Ms. Crabtree*, *Kansas City Shuffle*, *Release*, and *Zero
    Tolerance*. Based on the problems *Kansas City Shuffle* and *Release*, I
    believe this problem to be in the *Breezy Point* area.

    From Josh Dreher's 8a scorecard. Entry was made 5 November 2006 with the
    description "good problem with a big move to a small edge. Scary top out."
    Unlike the other entries made on this day, this problem was put in the
    *Breezy Point* sector (though those other problems likely existed at
    *Breezy Point* too.)

### North Seas

- More *Penthouse* problems

    There was originally more than one line in the *Penthouse*. Aside from the
    climb which starts in the schist slot on the left side of the face, what
    are the other problems on this wall?

## Horsethief Lake

- *The Midnight Cotiere of Sinister Intruders*

    From Michael Madsen's 8a scorecard. The entry was made 8 January 2014 with
    the description "SDS on crimps and work good crimps but bad feet. Jump for
    the top." The entry was logged in a sector of *Horsethief Lake* labeled
    *Talus Field*.

- Fryberger's Horsethief Traverse, V10, Chuck Fryberger

    It is rumored Chuck Fryberger established a V10 traverse around the
    Horsethief Lake area. It is unclear what the nature of this problem was.
    Chuck did not have any note of this on his 8a.nu scorecard, though problems
    like *No More Mr. T* (which is the only traverse I know he established) are
    also not listed in his scorecard.

    [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BFryberger%20Horsethief%20Traverse%5D)

## Old Baldy Mountain

- *MC Ollie*, V4, Greg Parker

  Likely between or around problems such as *Fisticuffs*/*Broken Hearts* and
  *Hidden Adjenda*. Upon further discussion it seems *MC Ollie* was most likely
  on *Schistty Ridge* in some manner. The ordering of the problems imply it's
  left of *Broken Hearts*, though that isn't confirmed. Has been described as
  possibly a "non-descript squattie."

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BMC%20Ollie%5D)

  There are also a few more undefined problems a V1 and two V2s, all FA'd by Greg Parker as sit starts. These are likely to the right of *Fisticuffs*, near *Brilliant*, or somewhere close by.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BRandoms%20around%20Fisticuffs%20or%20Brillaint%5D)

  - Traverse into Dyno, V3, Greg Parker

    Likely a traverse into the sesequent problem.

  - Travis Dyno, V2

    Travis Rypkema FA, or just a typo?

- Brain Fart, V6, Greg Parker

  A problem described as "little 5' boulder that is really hard." Possibly near
  the previous two problem sets.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BBrain%20Fart%5D)

- Stolen Thunder, V4, Greg Parker

  *Pulling Back a Stump*, etc.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BStolen%20Thunder%5D)

- *Marcel's Block*

  This is a large block developed by Marcel Mondova and Chipper Phillips. It is
  located southeastwardly adjacent to *Stranglehold*. It is estimated 11-13
  problems exist in the low-moderate grade range. The block is known, the
  problems are not.

- *Ego Stroke Arete*, V8, Chuck Fryberger

  From Chuck Fryberger's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 4 July 2003, in an
  unknown sector of Black Hills with the description "FA verm beta." Given 1/5
  stars. This entry is accompanied by an entry for *Goat Problem*, see below.
  The following day, Chuck ticked *Making Puppies*, *Kiss the Groove*, and
  *Dagron's Arete*. This leads me to believe these problems may be located
  around Baldy or maybe in Wayward Valley. These were likely done during the
  filming of *Friction Addiction*.

- *Eggspression*, V4

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 20 November 2003 in an
  unknown sector at Baldy with the description "not great". The only stretch of
  a lead I have on this problem is problems on *Eggstraordinary* are also
  egg-themed..

- *Teen Girl Club*, V4

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 23 December 2003 in and
  unknown sector of Old Baldy with the description "short roof." It was
  accompanied by a tick of *Right Handed Isosceles* the same day. I was told by
  a third party it was near the *Almost There Boulders*, but I'm not too
  convinced of that at the moment.

- Mysterious Caddyshack Boulder Fryberger V8s

  It has been reported to that Dan Dewell witnessed ascents of two V8-ish
  problems on the tall, steep face of the Caddyshack Boulder by Chuck
  Fryberger. I have assumed one of these V8 was a stand start left of
  *Looming*. That problem is still unconfirmed. The second V8 on the otherhand
  is a total mystery to me.

- *Give It the Finger*, V7, Chipper Phillips

  From Chipper Phillips and Justin Jaeger's 8a scorecards. Chipper Phillips'
  entry was made 30 May 2004 in an unknown sector of Old Baldy with a
  description "sit&go&stickitin." He gave it 3/5 stars and marked it as an FA.
  This entry is accompanied by an entry for *Stranglehold*. Justin Jaeger's
  entry was made 30 May 2004 in an unknown sector of the Black Hills with the
  description "burly crimp sds." He gate it 1/5 stars. It is accompanied by
  mulitple entries in *Irie Heights* such as *The Healing*, *The Offering*, and
  *Tastes Like Burning* as well as a *Sport Action Arete* eliminate. This all
  leads me to believe that *Give It the Finger* is a below average quality
  problem. It is most likely located somewhere in *Irie Heights*, but has the
  potential to be anywhere at Baldy, including along *Camp Judson Road*. The
  name and descriptions imply that it is a crimpy sit start, likely with a stab
  at some hold somehwere in the problem.

  Supposedly these are problems in the range of V0-4 that run in a corridor
  near or downhill from *Apparition*.

- *Stroller*, V8-11, Dan Dewell

  From Dan Dewells and Michael Madsen's 8a scorecards. Dan Dewell's entry was
  made 6 June 2005 in an unknown sector of Old Baldy with a description "with
  the sickness." He gave it 3/5 stars, a rating of V8, and marked it as an FA.
  Michael Madsen's entry was made 16 February 2014 in *Cell One Valley*. He
  gave it 5/5 stars and a rating of V10. I have received some information,
  including a photo and an upgrade to V11, of this supposed problem but I
  remain skeptical. The photo is located at the "top" of *Cell One Valley* but
  looks *extremely improbable*, even for V11. If this was *Stroller*, I doubt
  Dan Dewell would've graded it V8 considering 1. he supposedly climbed it in
  June, 2. he repeated The Prow in December of the same year and gave it V10.

- *Fit in the Sloper*, V4/5

  From Dan Dewell's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 6 July 2005 in an uknown
  sector at Baldy with the description "technically nota flash, but...". It was
  also accompanied by entries on the same day of *Banshee* and *Ghost Town
  Litigant*.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BFit%20in%20the%20Sloper%5D)

  Dan's scorecard contained another kind of "unnamed" entry on the same day,
  *Blake's Problem--left of 'Fit in the Sloper'*, V5/6. It had a description
  "Blake should send LayDS next." It think this is a sarcastic remark that this
  problem started abnormally low for the time.

  [Email me with more information.](mailto:logan.grosz@gmail.com?subject=%5BInfo%20Request%5D%5BLeft%20of%20Fit%20in%20the%20Sloper%5D)

- *Wayback*, V1/2, Dan Dewell

  From Dan and Blake's 8a scorecards. Dan's entry was added 24 July 2005 at Mt
  Baldy with the description "forgettable, at best", and makred as an FA. It
  was accompanied by entries for *Jug City* and *Skypager*. Blake's entry was
  added 6 August 2005 with the description "[h]mmmmm, appetizer." It was also
  accompanied by entries for *Jug City* and *Skypager*.

  Based on the adjacent entries, I think it's safe to say this problem is in,
  near, or on the way to *Cell One Valley*. If it's on *A Tribe Called Quest*
  boulder it could be the northeast arete or the north slab. It could also be
  on a neighboring block.

- *Kung Fu Spotting*, V4/5

  From Chipper Phillips' 8a scorecard. Entry was added 11 September 2005 in an
  uknown sector of Baldy with the description "stressfulfalls-nicespotJJ." It
  was accompanied by entries for *Jug City* and *Hueco Problem.* If I am to
  believe Justin Jaeger was along for the ride on this one, then looking at
  Justin's 8a scorecard, it is also accompanied by entries for *Banshee*,
  *Ghost Town Litigant*, *The Rambunction*, *Award Tour*, *Jug City*,
  *Skypager*, and *Organ Donor*. All this is to say, maybe it's in *Cell One
  Valley* - or maybe it's just somewhere random at Baldy.

## Sylvan Lake

- *Seared and Seething*, V4-7

  From Justin Jaeger's 8a scorecard. Entry was added 31 May 2004 in an unknown
  sector of the Black Hills with the description "FA 2move roof V4-7?." He gave
  it 1/5 stars and marked it as an FA. Other entries from that same day include
  *Temper Tantrum*, *Hatori Hanso*, *Samurai*, and *Five Point Palm Exploding
  Heart Technique*. I have also receive information from a third party saying
  this problem resides at Sylvan Lake. I am unsure if it may belong to *The
  Outlets* - like at the *Don Juan Boulder* -, at the *Honeymoon Boulders*, or
  elsewhere.

### Sign Boulders

- Crack Boulder

    Supposedly there's a boulder with an obvious crack and good landing located
    "behind" (north of?) *Punks In the Park*. This boulder supposedly only has
    one established problem as of 2016.

## Lost Media

- Mike Olson, *a.k.a. Red Dot Guy*, documentation

  Mike Olson was the infmaous "Red Dot Guy," who would paint red dots below his
  perceived first ascents. While many (most?) of these were already established
  problems, there were a few that are likely to be credited to him. Mike Olson
  did document his problems in a book or pamphlet. I have not been able to get
  my hands on this pamplet, but would love the opportunity.

## The advent of bouldering

Problems which I have discovered from the 1950s and 1960s are few and far
bewteen. These problems include those on the Campground Boulder, Inner
Outlet, the Outlet Boulder, the Thimble, the Scab, and the Butterfly Boulder.
There were a multitude of problems which I have failed to located or document
accurately.

### Herb and Jan Conn

Though they may not be modern boulders, John Gill writes in his personal blog
about Herb and Jan Conn...

> In the Needles of South Dakota, starting in 1949, Jan and Herb Conn
> practiced long ground-level traverses when not making first ascents of
> spires.

### 1950s and 1960s

Subsequently, he writes about introducing modern bouldering to the Hills in
the 1950s...

> I began visiting the Black Hills in the mid 1950s, introducing modern
> bouldering there. 
>
> From the late 1950s through the mid 1960s a number of (then) difficult
> problems were done on the coarse granite. 
>
> Other climbers contributing substantially to Needle bouldering during the
> 1960s include Bob Kamps, Rich Goldstone, and Pete Cleveland.
>
> All the classic problems on the Sylvan Lake Boulder were done by the early
> 1960s.  The Outlet Boulder was done a year or so later.

I have not located any *concrete problems*, though I have located some
formations, that can be directly attributed to anyone other than John Gill.
